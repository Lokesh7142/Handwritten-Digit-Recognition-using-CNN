## Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN
This project is developed as part of my internship at SkillHigh, focusing on applying Deep Learning techniques to recognize handwritten digits using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Objective
To build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) capable of accurately recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Project Description
- The model processes 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9) and learns to classify them using a CNN architecture built with TensorFlow/Keras. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, making it ideal for this kind of image classification task.

## Tools & Technologies
-Python

-TensorFlow / Keras

-NumPy

-Matplotlib

-Jupyter Notebook / Colab

## Skills Acquired
- Image Data Preprocessing (Normalization, Reshaping, One-hot Encoding)

- Building CNN Models (Conv2D, MaxPooling, Flattening, Dense Layers)

- Training and Evaluating Machine Learning Models

- Visualization of training progress and predictions

## Approach
- Import MNIST dataset

- Preprocess data (reshape, normalize, encode)

- Build the CNN model

- Conv2D → MaxPooling → Flatten → Dense

- Compile and train the model

- Evaluate the model performance

- Test predictions on sample images

## Model Performance
- Achieved accuracy of ~98% on the MNIST test dataset.

- Model evaluation includes metrics like accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix.

## Real-World Applications
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

- Digit Recognition in Bank Cheques, Postal Codes

- Automatic Form Processing

- License Plate Recognition Systems
