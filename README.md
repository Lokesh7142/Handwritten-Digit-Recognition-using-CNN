# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-CNN
The model processes 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9) and learns to classify them using a CNN architecture built with TensorFlow/Keras. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, making it ideal for this kind of image classification task.
